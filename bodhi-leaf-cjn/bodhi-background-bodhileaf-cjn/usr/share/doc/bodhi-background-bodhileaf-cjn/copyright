 This license agreement governs how you can use the free photos, illustrations,
 graphics, and vectors (“content”) that you download via FreeImages.com. By
 downloading content from FreeImages.com, you accept the terms and 
 conditions of this license agreement. For the sake of clarity, the terms
 and conditions of this license agreement only apply to free content 
 downloaded via FreeImages.com and do not apply to any content downloaded
 from any external websites (e.g., iStock).
 .
 What Type of License Am I Receiving?
 When you download content via FreeImages.com, you are granted a free, 
 non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use the content
 subject to the terms and conditions of this license agreement.
 .
 Only you are licensed to use the content, except that you may allow printers,
 distributors or other subcontractors (“Subcontractors”) to use the content
 in any production or distribution process related to your final end use. 
 Subcontractors must agree to be bound by the terms of this license agreement
 and may not use the content for any other purpose.
 .
 How Can I Use Licensed Content?
 You may use the content worldwide, in perpetuity, in any and all media in
 any way that is not restricted (see “Restricted Uses,” below, as well as
 any restrictions notified to you at the time of licensing). This includes
 the right to copy, display, reproduce, crop, modify, publish or otherwise
 make use of the content.
 .
 Types of Permitted Uses:
 Unless otherwise stated at the time of download, examples of how you can use
 the content include (but are not limited to): websites; blog posts; social
 media; advertisements; flyers; marketing campaigns; corporate presentations;
 school projects; newspapers; magazines; books; film and television productions;
 web and mobile applications; product packaging; personal non-commercial use;
 and, unless otherwise notified, commercial use. Please note that, where 
 commercial use is permitted, you must first significantly or meaningfully 
 modify, update, or otherwise incorporate additional creative elements into
 the end use such that it becomes your own creative work.
 .
 Restricted Uses:
 You must not:
 Use content in a pornographic, obscene, defamatory or other unlawful manner,
 or in any manner that could be considered offensive or flattering to the 
 person depicted in the content.
 Sell, sublicense, distribute or use the content in any way that allows third
 parties to download, extract, use or redistribute the content file itself
 (i.e., separate from your end use).
 .
 Use content as part of a trademark, design mark, tradename, business name,
 service mark, or logo.
 Falsely represent that you are the original creator of a work that is made up
 largely of licensed content.

 Use content in connection with any goods or services intended for resale or
 distribution where the primary value lies in the content itself including,
 without limitation, cards, stationery items, paper products, calendars, 
 apparel items, posters (printed on paper, canvas, or any other media), CDs,
 DVDs, mobile applications or other items for resale, license or other 
 distribution for profit. This includes “on-demand” products (meaning products
 in which content is selected by a third party for customization on such product
 on a made-to-order basis), including, without limitation, postcards, mugs,
 t-shirts, posters and other items (this includes the sale of products through
 custom designed websites, as well as sites such as zazzle.com and 
 cafepress.com).
 .
 Use content in electronic or digital templates intended for resale or other
 distribution (for example, website templates, business card templates, 
 electronic greeting card templates, brochure design templates).
 Please note that certain content cannot be used in a commercial manner. 
 Please refer to the license information available on the download page 
 for each item of content for any additional restrictions applicable to 
 that content.
 .
 Credit/Attribution
 Certain content providers require attribution when you use their content,
 such as a link or tagline in your blog or webpage next to the content. 
 You agree to comply with the credit requirements that are notified to you
 at the time of download. Unless otherwise specified at the time of download,
 you should include the following credit adjacent to the content or in
 visual production credits: "FreeImages.com/Artist's Name."

 All rights, including copyright and all other intellectual property rights
 in and to the content are owned by the content suppliers. 
 All rights not expressly granted to you by this license agreement are reserved
 by FreeImages.com and the content suppliers.
 .
 Termination
 The rights granted under this license agreement will immediately and 
 automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any term
 or condition of this license agreement, in which case you must immediately:
 cease using the content and delete or destroy any copies.
 .
 Upon notice or knowledge that any content downloaded via FreeImages.com
 may be subject to a claim of infringement of a third party's right, 
 FreeImages.com may require you to immediately, and at your own expense:
